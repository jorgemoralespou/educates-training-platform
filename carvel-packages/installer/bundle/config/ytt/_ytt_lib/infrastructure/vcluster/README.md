# generic
By default, only kyverno and educates will be installed
We only allow to enabling/disabling packages at users' risk (except for contour and lookup-service)
No configuration is provided for these packages.

TODO: Revisit the configuration for some of the packages. Should we allow for enabling external-dns, certs,...?

#   hack/generate-image-list.sh <version> <registry-host> <registry-namespace> [--no-digests]
#
# Writes one fully qualified image reference per line to stdout
# (`<repo>:<tag>@sha256:<digest>`), covering everything an install of the
# platform can need (see decisions.md "Image relocation is a published
# digest-pinned list"):
#
#   - the Educates platform images at the released version (operator,
#     runtime components, pause-container, docker-registry, ...);
#   - the full session-manager image inventory (the `imageVersions`
#     helper): the workshop base, the JDK and conda workshop
#     environments, and the optional runtime images for the vcluster
#     workshop application — vcluster itself plus its loft-sh Kubernetes
#     distro images, docker-in-docker, and the debian base. Extracted by
#     rendering the session-manager chart, so version bumps in the chart
#     flow through without editing this script;
#   - the upstream cluster-service images (cert-manager, Contour,
#     external-dns, Kyverno), extracted by rendering the vendored chart
#     tarballs with default values. Defaults are a superset of what the
#     operator enables, so this over-collects slightly rather than ever
#     missing an image.
#
# The list is intentionally COMPLETE — it includes the JDK/conda
# environments and the vcluster application images even though most
# installs use only a subset. When mirroring, delete the entries you do
# not use rather than guessing which ones might be missing. The
# JDK/conda environment images are multi-GB each.
#
# Digest resolution uses skopeo (preinstalled on GitHub runners) and
# requires the images to already be published — the release workflow
# runs this after the image-publish jobs. Use --no-digests for a local
# dry run without registry access.

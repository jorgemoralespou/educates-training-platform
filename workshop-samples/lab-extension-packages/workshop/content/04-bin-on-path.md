title: "The bin Directory on the PATH"
---

A `bin` directory at the root of a package with a manifest is added to the
application search path, so a program the package ships runs by name. The
package does not need to arrange this itself.

Run the packaged program:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  greeter
```

Confirm it is the one from the package rather than something else of the same
name:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  command -v greeter
```

It should resolve to `/opt/packages/greeter/bin/greeter`.

## The package did not set this up

The `greeter` package's setup script sets an environment variable for the
session, but it writes no `PATH` line:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  cat /opt/packages/greeter/setup.d/01-greeter.sh
```

The search path is arranged for any package which carries a manifest, as
`greeter` does, so an author does not repeat it.

Setting up the search path a second time, as happens when the workshop is
rebuilt, adds nothing more. The package's directory appears on it once:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -c '^/opt/packages/greeter/bin$'
```

It should print `1`.

## The right architecture was delivered

The package ships a different build of the program per architecture, under
`linux-amd64` and `linux-arm64` in the package source. One image reference
covers both, and the delivery picks the child matching the machine this
session runs on:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  greeter --which; uname -m
```

The two should agree: `linux-amd64` on an `x86_64` machine, `linux-arm64` on
an `aarch64` one.

## Setup scripts can run the package's programs

The package's `bin` directory is put on the search path just before the
package's setup script runs. The script called `greeter` when the session
started, before any of these pages ran. Its output is in the setup log:

```terminal:execute
command: |-
  grep '^greeter:' ~/.local/share/workshop/setup-scripts.log
```

A setup script can therefore use the programs its own package ships.

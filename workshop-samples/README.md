Workshop Samples
================

This directory contains various workshop samples. These are not intended for
end user consumption and are intended to provide some minimal pre-canned
workshops which can be used to test and demonstrate different features of
the Educates platform.

Deploying Workshops
-------------------

To deploy a workshop from one of the sub directories, first ensure you have
an Educates cluster available and the `educates` CLI installed. Then from the
root of the workshop sub directory, run the following commands.

Publish the workshop to the Educates cluster:

```
educates publish-workshop
```

Deploy the workshop so that it is available to users:

```
educates deploy-workshop
```

Once deployed, you can browse available workshops and access them by running:

```
educates browse-workshops
```

This will open a browser window where you can select and launch the workshop.

Infrastructure Providers
========================

Educates provides purpose-built configuration kinds for common infrastructure providers, and an Inline mode for clusters whose ingress and certificate management already exist. The provider-specific prerequisites and configuration are described below; the field-by-field reference is in [configuration settings](configuration-settings).

Installation to Amazon EKS
--------------------------

Use the `EducatesEKSConfig` kind. The operator installs the Educates training platform, Contour as the ingress controller (exposed via a LoadBalancer service), Kyverno for cluster and workshop security policy enforcement, [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) issuing a wildcard certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) via a Route53 DNS01 challenge, and [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) maintaining the wildcard DNS record in your Route53 hosted zone.

Prerequisites you must create up front:

* A Route53 hosted zone containing your wildcard ingress domain.
* Two IAM roles configured for [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html): one for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/route53/#eks-iam-role-for-service-accounts-irsa) and one for [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/aws.md#iam-roles-for-service-accounts), both granting access to the hosted zone. By default the roles are expected at `arn:aws:iam::{accountId}:role/educates-cert-manager` and `.../educates-external-dns`; override with `aws.certManagerRoleARN` / `aws.externalDNSRoleARN` if yours are named differently.

```yaml
apiVersion: cli.educates.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EducatesEKSConfig
aws:
  accountId: "123456789012"
  region: eu-west-1
  route53HostedZoneId: Z0123456789ABCDEF
domain: educates.example.com
acme:
  email: admin@example.com
```

Then `educates admin platform deploy --config config.yaml` against the EKS cluster's context.

Installation to Google GKE
--------------------------

Use the `EducatesGKEConfig` kind. The installed stack is the same as for EKS, with certificates and DNS handled through Google CloudDNS and authentication through [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).

Prerequisites you must create up front:

* A CloudDNS zone containing your wildcard ingress domain.
* Two Google service accounts bound for Workload Identity: one for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/google/#gke-workload-identity) and one for [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/gke.md), both with DNS admin rights on the zone. By default they are expected at `cert-manager@{project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and `external-dns@{project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`; override with `gcp.certManagerServiceAccount` / `gcp.externalDNSServiceAccount`.

```yaml
apiVersion: cli.educates.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EducatesGKEConfig
gcp:
  project: my-gcp-project
domain: educates.example.com
acme:
  email: admin@example.com
```

Installation to local Kind cluster
----------------------------------

For laptop use, prefer `educates local cluster create`, which creates the kind cluster, local image registry and Educates install in one command — see the [quick start guide](quick-start-guide) and [local environment](local-environment). The configuration kind behind it is `EducatesLocalConfig`.

To install Educates onto a kind cluster you created yourself, run `educates local cluster create --cluster-only` first (kind cluster + registry, no platform), or use `educates admin platform deploy` against any existing kind cluster with an `EducatesLocalConfig` file.

Installation to OpenShift
-------------------------

OpenShift clusters come with their own ingress router and security model, so they are installed in Inline mode using the `EducatesInlineConfig` kind: you declare the existing IngressClass, a wildcard TLS certificate Secret, and OpenShift's security context constraints as the cluster policy engine.

```yaml
apiVersion: cli.educates.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EducatesInlineConfig
domain: educates.apps.example.com
ingressClassName: openshift-default
wildcardCertificateSecret: wildcard-tls
policyEnforcement:
  clusterEngine: OpenShiftSCC
  workshopEngine: Kyverno
```

Workshop-level policy enforcement still uses Kyverno, which you must install yourself in Inline mode (or set `workshopEngine: None` — only acceptable for trusted users; see [cluster requirements](cluster-requirements)).

Other Kubernetes clusters
-------------------------

Any conformant Kubernetes cluster with an existing ingress controller can be targeted the same way with `EducatesInlineConfig`: provide the IngressClass name, a wildcard TLS Secret for your domain, and your policy engine choices.

For a fresh, dedicated cluster on an unlisted provider where you want Educates to install the cluster services itself (Managed mode with choices the narrow kinds don't expose), use the `EducatesConfig` escape hatch and author the `EducatesClusterConfig` spec directly — see [configuration settings](configuration-settings) and the [sample scenarios](https://github.com/educates/educates-training-platform/tree/develop/installer/samples).
